The following snippet creates a 5x5x5 cube. A 10x10x10 cube might run a little slow. Click Run underneath the following code cell.\n\nThe cube should appear in the middle of the browser, so it could be that the notebook covers the graph. In that case, you can click Minimize above the notebook to get a better look at the graph, or Ctrl-LeftMouse-Drag the canvas to move the graph over.\n\nThe values of the constants in the menu to the left are my best effort of finding middle ground between arriving at a final shape, and not blowing up the simulation. If you find the graph isn't behaving like it should (too sluggish, too close together), you can select Constants and carefully change Repulsion and Attraction. Each top slider in the settings is the constant's base, each bottom slider is the exponent. Together, these two sliders make the exponential value.\n\nFor example, after hitting Run below, you can select the lower Repulsion slider, clicking on its dot, then use the right keyboard arrow increase Repulsion by a factor of 10. I've erred on the side of slow but stable, to ensure the simulation doesn't crash while adding elements. After all of your objects have been created, dial up the repulsion to see the layout evolve to something more recognizeable."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"source":"graph.clear()\n\ngraph.constants = {\n  K: 0.2e0, // attraction K\n  f0: 0.2e2 // repulsion f0\n}\n\nconst wait = (delay) => new Promise((resolve, _) => setTimeout(resolve, delay));\n\nlet size = 5;\nlet deps = [];\nfor(let i=0; i<size; i++){\n  let cols = [];\n  for(let j=0; j<size; j++){\n    let row = [];\n    for(let m=0; m<size; m++){\n      let v = graph.addVertex({size: 0.5, color: Math.floor(Math.random()*0xffffff)}).id;\n      await wait(10);\n      \n      if(m > 0){\n        graph.addEdge(v, row[row.length - 1]);\n        await wait(10);\n      }\n      \n      if(j > 0){\n        graph.addEdge(v, cols[cols.length - 1][m]);\n        await wait(10);\n      }\n      \n      if(i > 0){\n        graph.addEdge(v, deps[deps.length-1][j][m]);\n        await wait(10);\n      }\n      \n      row.push(v);\n    }\n    cols.push(row);\n  }\n  deps.push(cols);\n}\n\ngraph.constants = {\n  K: 0.2e1,\n  f0: 0.2e3\n}","outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":[]},{"data":{"text/plain":""},"execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}]}]}
