    <h1>VerticesAndEdges.net Examples</h1>
    <p><em>Basically anything with arrows!</em></p>

    <h2>Notebooks to play with</h2>
    <p>
      Besides the GUI, you can also control the graph via notebook. The notebook cells have a built-in <em>graph</em> variable that you use to call 
      addVertex, addEdge, removeVertex, and removeEdge, allowing you to script a graph to your liking. The cells support await and return (in fact they
      get executed as asynchronous functions). You can return strings, numbers, and html elements. For more functionality, see 
      <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import">import(...)</a> on MDN.<br>

      Below are a short handful of notebooks. Cube and Micrograd have shapes for you to play with, while Quickstart and Minimal Graph are about providing
      detailed instructions on how to use the notebook.

      That's all. Feel free to email me at joshua.moore@verticesandedges.net should you find something broken or think of an improvement.

    <h2>What can I do with it?</h2>
    <p>
      Using <a href="">fetch(...)</a> call, you can load data from a url and visualize it using the graph. The possibilities are endless, basically
      anything with arrows. 
    </p>

    <h2>What's the catch?</h2>
    <p>
      The other planned version, social.verticesandedges.net (not up yet), will charge a small $$$ amount for server features like sharing and publishing. 
      That said, this version will be able to open notebooks and graphs published from social, and vice versa.
